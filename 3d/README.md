## Files

All design files are made with FreeCad. The STL files provided are not neccesarily up to date, but it's all compatible.

### Main body (fit's all)

This version is 5mm higher than the earlier revision, so it fits the classic MIDI Sprout,
even those with trough-hole LEDs or a protruding oscillator.

But I also recommend it for variants with flat LEDs (like newer MIDI Sprouts from DataGarden or the the MIDI Biodata Sonification Device v2.1 by 13-37.org) 
as it has better light diffusion with the increased distance.

### Main body (older version)

This version fits only the MIDI Biodata Sonification Device v2.1 by 13-37.org, and is 5mm smaller(in height) than the version above.

Just a plate of 51,5mm x 48,75mm x 1mm. It snaps into the main body.
